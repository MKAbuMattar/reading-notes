## Introducing How computer work

The first step for learning code, this learn how computers work, how components in the computer transfer data between each hardware and software, and you will realize all data transfer in low level `0` `1` all components start as a circuit, all that showing how new live new world of technology in daily future.

## How Computers Work: What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

The common thinks for all computers:
-   Input
-   Storage
-   Processing
-   Output

The old computer has the same size as the room and takes hours and hours just to do a basic math problem, the old computer starts doing math, but now you can play games, coding, create documents, and do multiple tasks.

### Input

The input this a stuff you insert into your computer used keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera, touch screen

### Storage

All the input you give a computer will be stored in memory

### Processing

All stored data it's will be processing all data to show a piece of information and manipulates and changes in processing using an algorithm and after processed all information and it will be stored in memory.

### Output

A computer will display your output, like photos, videos, games, text...

## How Computers Work: Binary & Data

At now level of language programming, nobody today actually `0` `1` directly.

Number System
Binary `0 1`
Decimal `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`

all text, image, video, sound webpage, all this stored as a binary system.

## How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic

all pice of info this represents a `1` `0` for the process it, you need to logic to algorithms, for the process it pice of info to get output and for display your output it will change a small thing in circuits using your output `0` `1`.

Simple circuits have `NOT` `AND` `OR` and if you have multiple signals you need more complicated circuits and complex circuits.

## How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output
 
all info you insert input will convert to binary and the CPU this will do all calculations and after processing that a piece of info. this reconverts it into a physical output in modern PC have multiple CPU for process all info.

## How Computers Work: Hardware and Software

The computer this computation between hardware and software, it's will give you a video, image, or game, CPU control processing unit master chip controls all part of your PC.
