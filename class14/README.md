The layout is one of the important things when you build a website, any layout deposit in UI/UX, UI is made up of all the elements that help someone to communicate with a product or service at the most simple level. The customer experience, on the other hand, is what the consumer using the product or service gets out of the whole thing.

To achieve the most benefit from UI/UX, You should know each most used element and how to use the elements within the web page.

Key Concepts in Positioning Elements, Block-level elements, Inline elements, We talked previously about these elements Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript [Link](../class07/README.md#structure)

You can manipulate, control and transform elements just as you wish, example:

style.css
```css
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  text-align: center;
}

nav {
  background-color: black;
  height: 40px;
}

ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding-top: 10px;
}

li {
  display: inline;
  padding: 10px;
}

a {
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
}
```

index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <title>Layout</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
</head>

<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Layout</h1>
  </header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="">About me</a></li>
      <li><a href="">Work</a></li>
      <li><a href="">Contact us</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</body>

</html>
```
