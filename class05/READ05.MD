## Operators

You'll assess a situation by contrasting one of the script's characteristics with the desired outcome.

-   is equal to`==`
-   is not equal to `!=`
-   strict equal to `===`
-   strict not equal to `!==`
-   greater than `>`
-   less than `<`
-   greater than or equal to `>`
-   less than or equal to `<`

```javascript
(score >= pass )
```
-   `()` enclosing brackets
-   `score` & `pass` operand
-   `>=` comparison operator

### logical operators

You may use logical operators to compare the results of two or more true or false operators.

```javascript
( (5<2) && (2 >= 3) )
```
-   `( () && () )` do expression 1 and expression 2 both evaluate. * expression 3*
`(5<2)` expression 1
`&&` logical operatore
`(2 >= 3) ` expression 2

Logical operators:

-   `&&` logical  and
-   `||` logical or
-   `!` logical not

## Loops
Loops this to repeat a block of code.

Three types of looping:
-   `for`
-   `while`
-   `do while`
All loops have three characteristics:

-   `var i = 0;` initialization
-   `i < 10;` condition
-   `i++` update
