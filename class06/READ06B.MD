### RGB values:
```css
p {
	color: rgb(100,100,90)
}
```
or
```css
p {
	color: rgba(100,100,90,1)
}
```
RGB stands for red, green, and blue. and RGBA stands for alpha. (opacity).

## Background Color

}
```

## Opacity

As I previously said, RGBA stands for RGBA, and A stands for alpha(opacity). Another method it's HSL, which stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. HSL also has HSLA, and you guessed it A stands for alpha(opacity).
