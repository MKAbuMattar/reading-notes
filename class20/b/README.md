## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams. David Wheeler: Study shows that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together, he says. Wheeler: More than three-quarters of an employee's day is spent communicating with colleagues, and it's getting more and more difficult. The time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more, a study says.  Back To the pageYou came from.

Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments. Rozovsky hoped shared experiences would make it easy for them to work well together. Instead, her study group was a source of stress. 

Yale student Rozovsky was on a team that came up with a plan for a business to replace a campus snack store. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Eventually, the team settled on a plan on a micro­gym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. The team won the competition, but Rozovsky's study group dissolved in her second semester. Her case team, however, stuck together for the two years she was at Yale and they won the contest, she says. 'I couldn't figure out why things had turned out so different,' Rozovsky says. ''It didn't seem like it had to happen that way''  "We're living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity," says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University.  Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of.

As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. Studies show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. Google has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees' lives. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together, writes John Bare. Back  .

Google researchers looked at the composition of groups inside the company. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team's success. No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns. ''We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference,'' one manager said. The 'who' part of the equation didn't seem to matter, he said.  ''Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work,'' he said, "and it turned out no one had really had to be on an initiative" to be successful in the Google experiment.  "Project Aristotle" began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked, he added.   ''We looked at 180 teams from all over the company,'' another said.

'Group norms' are traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Google researchers looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an ''unwritten rule'' Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn.  

Researchers looked at over a hundred groups for more than a year to see which norms mattered most to effective teams. The data didn't offer clear verdicts, they found. Sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them, they say. The research was conducted by Google's Project Aristotle, a social-networking program for teams.  Backto the page You came from,     The researchers looked at more than 100 groups for their research.

Researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I.Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member. They recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments. Teams that did well on one assignment tended to do well on all the others, they found. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything, they said. The right norms could raise a group's collective intelligence, but the wrong norms could hobble it, they say. 

I lost my patience and stood readers were very boring.
