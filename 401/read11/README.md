## Spring MVC and Thymeleaf

The following are the components of an MVC application:
@Controller classes are in charge of populating a model map with data and picking a displayed view.
In the case of Thymeleaf, the model map is converted into a Thymeleaf context object, which makes all the declared variables available to expressions run in templates.

Model attributes are what Spring MVC refers to as the data that may be accessible during the execution of views context variables. - Model characteristics in the Thymeleaf language


Parameters for the request
Thymeleaf views provide easy access to request parameters, which are sent from the client to the server.


Attributes of the session
The session. prefix or #session can be used to access session characteristics.
Attributes of the ServletContext
ServletContext characteristics are shared throughout requests and sessions, and you may use the #servletContext prefix in Thymeleaf to access them.
