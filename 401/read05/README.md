### Types of Linked List

In a linked list, there is only one reference, and that reference leads to the next node. There is a reference to both the Next and Previous node, which seems doubtful. It does not finish with a node pointing to a null value in a circular linked list. Instead of the traditional head node, it features a node that functions as the tail of the list, and the node following the tail node is the list's start.

### Big O


Big O Notation is a method of evaluating an algorithm's performance. It's a means of expressing how long a function, operation, or algorithm takes to perform based on the number of elements we provide to it. An O(1) function runs in constant time, which means that no matter how huge our input is, our algorithm will always require the same amount of time and memory to run.

### The linked list's 

The linked list's head node is located. We'll create a new node and set its reference to the list's current first node. The pointer on our head node is rearranged to point to our new node.
