# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

Functional programming is a programming framework in which functions are used to build and structure code. When given the same input, the output is still the same.

There are no mutations or shared states allowed, as functions should be pure and true to their representation in this paradigm. It is declarative rather than formal or imperative.

You may also think of Functional Programming as a set of functions that don't allow outside scope or object mutation. Functional is basic, straightforward, and does not mutate, unlike OOP, which mutates arrays by adding/removing within the domain to obtain a solution. It provides a straightforward response to its elegant function.

The programming language JavaScript is multi-paradigm. It doesn't mean you're using the paradigm either because it can declare functions. To completely use it, it must be implemented correctly. Functional Programming has the advantage of treating functions as first-class people.
