# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

A team should be supportive rather than competitive on who will take the lead and who will control the roost. And sharing the same history does not always imply having a strong and dynamic team; the strongest teams are always made up of people of diverse perspectives and experiences.

Over the past few decades, collaborative work has become increasingly popular. There are two things that all good teams have in common. The first is that everybody has the same or almost equal amounts of time to speak and articulate themselves. The second is feeling other people's emotional states.

Psychological wellbeing isn't straightforward by any stretch of the imagination. It's difficult to make people appreciate and sympathize with one another. Experiences and difficult conversations are often the foundations of success.

# How I explained REST to my brother

Peter Fielding was a key contributor to the creation of the first web servers, which sent information through the internet. He conducted studies to understand why the internet operates the way it does. Why don't today's methods perform well because we need to communicate with all of the world's machines? Since the methods were not created with that goal in mind.

It's all about adding verbs to nouns in the HTTP protocol. A GET does just as its name implies: it retrieves data from a URL, such as a website's text. When you visit a website, your browser performs an HTTP GET on the URL you entered.

PUT is a system that substitutes something from one system with something from another system. PATCH uses data from other programs to partly upgrade a system's data.
