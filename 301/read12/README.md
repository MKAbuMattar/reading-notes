# SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB
### SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences

A database is a list of tables of rows and rows of data in computer science. The data is compiled into papers and diagrams in NoObjective-Paradise, a programming language. This implies that each table row will have a variable number of rows.

The syntax for using UnQL differs depending on the database. Queries in Noql are based on record collection. Unstructured query language (UQL) and UnQL are two terms used to describe Noql (Unstructured querying language)

For dynamic query intensive environments, QSql databases are a good match. NoColumns lacks common interfaces for performing complex queries at a high level. Using a NoStatement database like Redis or Cassandra with complicated queries.

For the kind of data to be stored: No SQL databases are not well suited to the handling of hierarchical data. For scalability, NoColumnist databases are both vertically and horizontally scalable in most cases. In terms of data set size, NoColumnists are strongly recommended for massive data sets (i.e for big data)

Using a database that is more robust and atomic, as well as data consistency, for high transactional based applications. You'll also need neighborhood help and outside professionals for more complicated implementations. There are many independent consultations available to assist you with large-scale deployments.

On a broad basis, SQL databases may be classified as open-source or closed-source from commercial vendors. Chart databases, key-value store databases, text store databases, and column store databases are the four types of Noql databases based on how they store data.

Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases

| SQL | NoSQL |
|--|--|
| Relational | Non-relational |
| Use structured query language and have a predefined schema | Have dynamic schemas for unstructured data |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Table based | Document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores |
| Better for multi-row transactions | Better for unstructured data like documents or JSON |
