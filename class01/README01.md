# Text Editor & CLI
Choosing a VScode as a mine text editor, it's user friendly, easy to use, as a build-in emmet, my secondary text editor is sublime text 3 for fast retouch for code or chaining some code, faster than VScode in the launch, but VSCode still my mine choose.

CLI or Command Line Interface, it's a defiant way to interact with a computer, best in a command-line same as GUI but faster than GUI and u git in your point, each OS have own Terminal but still, all CLI have similarity in some command line.

In CLI you can navigate between folders and files, and you can copy and best file or folders or change root file, and this same command line:
* `pwd`: to show your directory or path you in.
* `ls`: for showing your list files and folders
* `cd`: for changing your location file to make it used, make it as your directory for the new command you'll use it in at.

> note Terminal or CLI is case sensitive.

Files, each file have one extension and these extensions are universal like:
* pic.png, pic.jpg -an image.
* index.html - an HTML file work in the browser.
* style.css - a CSS file for styling a HTML file.
as well you can use CLI to create files and list all your files, and u can change the names of files.
